**Every skill has a learning curve - Dreyfus model**

 * Any project can be broken down into specific technical actions
 * Any action can be performed in about an hour
 * Any specific action can be learned in about eight hours
 * Each time an action is successfully done the learning time is cut in half
 * This explains the 10x penalty for using unknown technology


**Fifty tricks model**

 * The typical project involves about 50 tricks
 * Part of assessing technical feasibility is create a catalog of tricks
 * Estimate the learning time for each trick
 * Add up the time to perform each action and the learning
 * Double the result (you only know 50% at the beginning of the project)


**Assessing and measuring skills**

 * Dreyfus Model: Novice, Beginner, Competent, Proficient, Expert
 * Each new skill has its own experience level
 * Create a map of skills needed and possessed
 * Budget for learning achieve new skill levels


**Learning is everything**

 * 50 tricks in 50 hours
 * 50 new tricks takes 400 hours
 * typical project: 40 old tricks (40 hours), 10 new tricks (80 hours)
 * productivity is based on knowledge, not effort


**Tools versus skills**

 * Everyone wants a magic bullet
 * No tool eliminates the need for engineering
 * Tools typically address a small portion of the work needed
 * Tools don't matter at all if you are solving the wrong problems


**Mentor models**

 * Cultivate a culture for mentoring
 * Require growth (your future success depends on it)
 * Chart skill development individually and for your team
 * People are your primary asset; invest in them
