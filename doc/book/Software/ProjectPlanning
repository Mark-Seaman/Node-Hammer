*Scope control is what guarantees success*
---

**Common problems with scope**

 * Identify the high risk areas
 * Wait until you know more to commit to features
 * Create the essential things first
 * Let feedback drive development


**Honesty is the best policy**

 * Never agree to a death march
 * Constantly be negotiating expectations
 * Beware of unstated expectations
 * Short-cuts cost more


**Force prioritization**

 * Everything is most important, same as no priority
 * Create and review your priorities rather than wait
 * Make small adjustments, not big ones
 * Shift discussion from predicting to demonstrating


**Tracking dashboard**

 * Demonstrate progress every week
 * Get business value by completing features
 * When will it be done? Use a burndown graph
 * Account for unknowns
