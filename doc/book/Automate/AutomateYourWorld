How to make computers simplify your life.
 by Mark Seaman

There is a huge gap between people that know how to get things done
and those who constantly struggle to stay above the water.  Life
is filled with noise and appointments, demands and distractions.  The
modern world is increasing the stress that we feel just to keep up.

This is a guide for how you can take back control.  Use computers to
control key aspects of your life that may have gotten away from you.
Automate critical repetitive tasks.  This will free up more time to do
the things you enjoy.

Have you ever noticed how some people are able to always manage to keep
everything organized?  They seem to have a system for everything.
They don't forget appointments, they can find information quickly, and
they never seem to be stressed by all of the demands.

You can get to that same state also.  With a little thought you can
create systems that work for you.  Find your own balance of
organization versus freedom. Create tools that work exactly like you
think rather than being forced to use someone else's idea of how
things should be.

In this book we will focus on the general principles of creating
effective tools that are fully customized for you.  See what works and
what doesn't and quickly get to a point where your tools are a natural
extension of your personality.

It is time for a shift in mindset that will lead you to the next level
of personal effectiveness.  Create an amazing life where you focus on
the interesting parts rather than the mundane.  Have systems that
remember all of the important information, tasks, and contacts, so that
you don't have to.

Each chapter will be look at an important area of this discussion.
