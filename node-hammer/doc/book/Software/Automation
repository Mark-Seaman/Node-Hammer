* World-class Automation *                 -*-muse-*-

*Humans create systems, computers run them*
---

**Every repetitive task must be automated**

 * Never duplicate 
 * Turn knowledge into a script
 * Task encapsulation
 * GUI's are the slow way (and cannot be scripted)


**Calculate the return for each automation project**

 * New command in 5 seconds
 * New tool in 1 hour
 * Small savings add up
 * Spend 50% of your time building tools (solve the meta-problem)


**90% of your testing should be automatic**

 * Automated testing is no more expensive during development
 * 10x savings over brute-force testing with people
 * Tests run every hour
 * Any errors are found as soon as they happen
 * Don't ignore automatic test results
 * Create own tooling language


**Reconstruct the world each time you run the script**

 * Destroy the old world and reset the context
 * Have different levels of reset
 * One result requires one command
 * Build your library of commands (build 5 a day)
