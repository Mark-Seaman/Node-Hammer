Automation

Some tasks are done many times during the course of a project.  As a
developer it is easy to automate these tasks the first time they are
needed.  Then the task can be redone simply by typing the name of the
goal (for example, “email”, “build” or “deploy-web-site”).

This allows you to build up an arsenal of commands for every
conceivable task that you to repeatedly.  Each of these task commands
may save several seconds, which adds up in the course of a day.  But
the real savings is the focus that it allows.  You are constantly
thinking about the goal, rather than how the goal is to be achieved.

For infrequently done tasks, there is a completely different reason
for wanting to automate. Doing software development requires constant
problem solving.  Each new trick must be learned.  If the solution to
a problem is not used very often then each time requires relearning.

Instead of documenting the solution to a problem, consider writing a
script.  All of the particulars that are related to the specific
context can be either hard coded or supplied as parameters.

In the future when you need to do the task the script will act as your
guide.  Even if the context has changed the script can show you how
the problem was solved before (with concrete values).
